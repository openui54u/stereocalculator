On sterescopic photography there is a formula to calculate disparity. Based on the inter axial base of the 2 camera’s, the distance to the subject , in plane, and the most far object. With a IA ( base ) of 19cm, when the object is at 3m distance , what is the far distance maximum when displaying on a 52” tv? Taking into accpunt max disparity of 2% of screen with. And how mich disparity in cm is on the screen?

CHATGTP generator code for stereoscopic side by side rig stereo 3d photography


### Explanation:
- Instead of calculating the disparity on the screen as a fixed percentage of the screen width, we now calculate it as a percentage of the screen width using the correct formula: disparityCm / screenWidth.

### Instructions:
1. Copy the updated code above and save it as an HTML file (e.g., stereo_calculator.html).
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. Adjust the sliders to set the values for the interaxial base (IA), distance to the subject, far distance, lens focal length, and TV screen size.
4. Observe the calculated results update in real-time as you adjust the sliders.

Using a logarithmic scale can indeed make it easier to adjust sliders for values that span several orders of magnitude, especially for distances where fine control over smaller values is needed.

Here's how you can implement logarithmic sliders in your code:

1. Convert the slider values to a logarithmic scale for input.
2. Convert the logarithmic values back to a linear scale for calculations.

(code)

### Explanation:

1. *Logarithmic Scale*:
    - For distance and farDistance, the slider values are converted to a logarithmic scale using Math.log10(value).
    - For calculations, these values are converted back to the linear scale using Math.pow(10, value).

2. *Fine Control*:
    - This approach allows for finer control over smaller values while still allowing adjustments over a wide range.

3. *Sliders*:
    - The step value for the sliders is set to 0.01 for distance and farDistance to ensure smooth adjustments.

Please give this updated code a try and see if it improves the ease of adjusting the distances. Let me know if you have any further requests or need more adjustments.

### Changes made:
1. *Distance Slider*:
    - The logarithmic scale is used to make it easier to adjust distances.
    - The range of the slider for the distance to the subject is set from 0.1 to 100 meters.

2. *Far Distance Slider*:
    - The range of the slider for the far distance is set from 0.1 to 1000 meters.

3. *Lens Focal Length*:
    - Increased the maximum focal length to 800 mm.

4. *Disparity as a Fraction*:
    - Added a calculation to display the disparity percentage as a fraction (1/x).
