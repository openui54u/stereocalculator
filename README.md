CHATGTP generator code for stereoscopic side by side rig stereo 3d photography


### Explanation:
- Instead of calculating the disparity on the screen as a fixed percentage of the screen width, we now calculate it as a percentage of the screen width using the correct formula: disparityCm / screenWidth.

### Instructions:
1. Copy the updated code above and save it as an HTML file (e.g., stereo_calculator.html).
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. Adjust the sliders to set the values for the interaxial base (IA), distance to the subject, far distance, lens focal length, and TV screen size.
4. Observe the calculated results update in real-time as you adjust the sliders.
